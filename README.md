This is a program that calculates the average sentiment value (how negative/positive) a piece of given text is based on a "dictionary" (CSV) file that has a list of many words and their sentiment value. This program is based on the AP CSA NLP project program - that is where the CSV and the idea originated, however this program was written by scratch in python to aid in processing and tos treamline the process entierly. It was also interesting to do this in python to try and translate code from different languages, and write it in a manor that allows for more usages as a package. It also would allow for future projects and expansions.
